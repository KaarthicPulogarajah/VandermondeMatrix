# VandermondeMatrix
Fit a Polynomial Function to a series of data points

This program uses the least squares method of regression to fit a polynomial of a user-specified degree to the data points given by the user.
A Vandermonde Matrix is created from the x-values of the data points, and is used to generate a vector that corresponds to the coefficients
of the polynomial.
This program is especially useful when analyzing data to generate a polynomial of best fit.
